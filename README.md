***Goal:*** create three small medium large image sets. Place the image in a responsive images and can visually identify the diffrence.

Created multiple html and css for newsletter , inquires and main. So it will not create any confusion. Also in future I can use indiviual files. 

Store each and every images in asset folder having size under 100k.

The only problem is when I open in google chrome its not giving me results but when i open in firefox nightly its showing image transition as per the requirements. Also for the small image I have to inspect and click that little icon for desktop and mobile (Responsive design mode) one to see all transition.

***Asset:***

Full, medium, large and small images in asset folder with main css.

Images downloded from free sources [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/)
